# LEAD VALIDATOR

This is an API for validating a lead to check if it could become a prospect.

Core Functionality:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sechchr22/addi.git
```
Build the environment
```sh
pipenv shell (for example)
```
install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
if you are going to use developing functionalities

## RUN
being in main folder

Run the app
```sh
python -m infrastructure.delivery.strategy.strategy
```
Run the tests
```sh
python -m pytest -s tests/bussines_logic_tests.py
```

## USE
To use it. Is just and /evaluation/ endpoint with this payload(example) on it

```sh
{
    "nin": 12345,
    "birthdate": "22/05/1994",
    "first_name": "sergio",
    "last_name": "rueda",
}
```

curl example (if running on localhost port 8080)
```sh
curl -v -X POST "http://0.0.0.0:8080/evaluation" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"nin":12345, "birthdate": "22/05/1994", "first_name": "sergio", "last_name": "rueda"'
```

You will recieve a response with the lead nin, the evaluation and the score
```sh
{"validation":{"lead_nin":12345,"evaluation":"lead"}}
```
